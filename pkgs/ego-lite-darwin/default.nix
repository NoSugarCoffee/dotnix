# ego lite is not in nixpkgs and ships only as a macOS DMG (Windows and Linux
# are on upstream's roadmap), so this repacks the official prebuilt app --
# same approach as claude-desktop-darwin. The bundle arrives notarized with
# an intact seal, so it is copied verbatim.
#
# Upstream publishes no versioned download URL: the token below is rewritten
# in place on each release, so release_pins.py re-prefetches it nightly and
# bumps the hashes in pin.json; the version label there has to be corrected by
# hand from CFBundleShortVersionString.
#
# `version` describes the DMG in the store, which is not necessarily the
# version that runs: EgoUpdater rewrites the installed app in place, and can
# do that because home-manager copies the bundle out to a writable path
# rather than symlinking the store.

  # `ego-browser` is the whole point of the package for agent use, and it is
  # not a separate download: it is a self-contained helper (Mach-O with an
  # embedded Node) inside the app bundle. Upstream's GUI onboarding is what
  # normally drops it into ~/.local/bin; this puts it on PATH declaratively
  # instead.
  #
  # It picks the bundle at run time instead of symlinking the store's, because
  # a store symlink strands PATH on the DMG's build while the browser service
  # it drives moves on with each EgoUpdater release. That skew is worth this
  # much indirection because the service misreports it: 0.4.7.4 driving
  # 0.5.0.28 failed `import --browser chrome` with
  # SOURCE_DATABASE_COOKIES_TOO_OLD against a profile whose cookie schema
  # matched ego's own exactly.
