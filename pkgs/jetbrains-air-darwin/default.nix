# JetBrains Air (agentic development environment) isn't in nixpkgs, so this
# repacks the official prebuilt macOS app from JetBrains' DMG -- same approach
# as claude-desktop-darwin. Air is still a preview product: JetBrains ships
# per-arch DMGs and prunes older preview builds from the CDN, so pin.json
# needs bumping fairly often; release_pins.py follows the JetBrains products
# API for it.

  # Unlike the other DMG-packaged darwin apps in this repo, Air's DMG (as of
  # 262.1037.6) is a flat GPT image with a single "whole disk" blkx entry
  # instead of the legacy Apple Partition Map undmg expects (one blkx per
  # partition, named e.g. "Apple_HFS (...)"). undmg only recognizes HFS by
  # that name match, so it can't tell this is HFS+ and bails with "only HFS
  # file systems are supported" even though the volume inside is plain
  # HFS+. 7-Zip parses the GPT partition table and HFS+ filesystem directly
  # and preserves the symlinks/permissions the app bundle needs.
